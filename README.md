# IOcontrol
A program that makes interfacing with the Raspberry Pi GPIO easier.
By using a few simple commands, you can now control and read
the gpio pins of your Raspberry Pi directly without having the need to write any code.
This program utilizes the direct register control approach of the [bcm2835 library](http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/) rather than the Linux sysfs in handling the Raspberry Pi GPIO.
