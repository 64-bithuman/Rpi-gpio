# Rpi-gpio v1.0
This version supports reading bit values from GPIO pins and changing the state of GPIO pins (ON to OFF); but more functionality will be added in future releases. There are 5 available commands. Each of their functions are described below.

***
1. "config n p" : This command configures the gpio number n to either 'in' (input) or 'out' (output) as indicated by p.  
2. "set n p" : This command sets the gpio n to either 'read' (read gpio), 'on' (turn gpio on) or 'off' (turn gpio off) as indicated by p.  
3. "#exit n n" : This command exits the program; n can be any value.  
4. "pinout" : This command shows a list of pins and their corresponding GPIO numbers.  
5. "help n n" : This command shows a list of available commands and their usage. n can be any value.   
***Note: commands must be entered into the program without quotes.***
